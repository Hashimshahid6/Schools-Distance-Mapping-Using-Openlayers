Challenges:

##Limited GIS Access and Remote School Mapping:
The foundation lacked access to GIS software, hindering their ability to map schools in remote areas effectively.

Project School Differentiation and User-Friendly Interface:
Identifying and distinguishing between various project schools on the map posed a challenge, especially for non-GIS experts. A user-friendly interface was crucial for accessibility.

Integration of Advanced Features:
The need for features such as distance measurement, multiple map views, and dynamic project filtering added complexity to the project.

Technological Accessibility and Data Retrieval:
Considering diverse technological capabilities among users, ensuring cross-device compatibility and enabling easy data retrieval were critical.

Tasks:

OpenLayers-Based Web Mapping Application:
Developed a web-based mapping application using the OpenLayers JavaScript library to overcome the reliance on traditional GIS software and facilitate remote school mapping.

Visual Indicators and Streamlined Interface:
Integrated distinct visual indicators for each project school to aid differentiation. Designed a user-friendly interface catering to individuals with limited GIS knowledge.

Comprehensive Feature Integration:
Successfully incorporated advanced features into the mapping application, including distance measurement tools, the ability to switch between OpenStreetMap and Satellite views, and dynamic project filtering.

Cross-Device Compatibility and Enhanced Search Functionality:
Ensured the mapping application's compatibility across various devices and browsers. Implemented a robust search functionality for easy data retrieval, including location coordinates and school-specific information.
